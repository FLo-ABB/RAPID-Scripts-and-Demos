# PickPlace Module

## Overview
The PickPlace module is a RAPID program designed for ABB robots to perform pick and place operations in a matrix-like arrangement. It provides a flexible and robust solution for handling objects in a predefined grid pattern.

## Features
- Configurable matrix dimensions (columns, rows, levels)
- Adjustable spacing between positions
- Z-offset for approach and retreat movements
- Error handling for invalid position indices
- Customizable gripper control

## Constants
- `nZOffset`: Vertical offset for approach and retreat movements
- `nGripperPickTime`: Time delay for pick operation
- `nGripperPlaceTime`: Time delay for place operation
- `nColumnCount`: Number of columns in the matrix
- `nRowCount`: Number of rows in the matrix
- `nLevelCount`: Number of levels in the matrix
- `nColumnSpacing`: Spacing between columns
- `nRowSpacing`: Spacing between rows
- `nLevelSpacing`: Spacing between levels

## Main Procedures
1. `PerformMatrixOperation`: Executes pick or place operation at a specified matrix position
2. `PickWithZOffset`: Performs a pick operation with a vertical offset
3. `PlaceWithZOffset`: Performs a place operation with a vertical offset
4. `ControlGripper`: Manages gripper actions (pick or place)

## Usage
To use the PickPlace module:

1. Configure the constants according to your setup.
2. Adjust the `myTool` and `myWobj` data to match your robot configuration.
3. Modify the `pMatrixOrigin` to set the starting point of your matrix.
4. Call `PerformMatrixOperation` with the desired position index and operation type.

Example:
```rapid
PerformMatrixOperation 0, \pick;  ! Pick from position 0
PerformMatrixOperation 20, \place;  ! Place at position 20
```

## Error Handling
The module includes error handling for invalid position indices. If an out-of-range index is provided, it will raise a custom error (ERR_INDEX) with a descriptive message.

## Customization
- Gripper Control: Modify the `ControlGripper` procedure to implement your specific gripper logic.
- Speed: Adjust the `vPickPlace` constant to change the operation speed.
- Matrix Configuration: Modify the matrix constants to match your specific arrangement.
